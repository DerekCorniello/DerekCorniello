## 👋 Hello, I'm Derek Corniello!
I'm a CS/SWE student at the University of Cincinnati. I have interned with Siemens
Digital Industry Software for the last 2 years, working on backends and API design.
I will be at Fifth Third Bank over the spring and LinkedIn over the summer. I’m excited about 
software product design, project management, and back-end development. My curiosity and
eagerness to learn drive me to keep exploring, one project and concept at a time! Please
